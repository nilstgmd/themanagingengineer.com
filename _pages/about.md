Thanks for visiting this blog.

## About Me

I'm Nils, a computer scientist based in Hamburg, Germany. I love photography and nerd stuff. I hate cables on my desk, but accept them if connected to my mechanical keyboard. I drive a fast car, but most of the time really slow. I consider myself a sports person, never managed to be exceptionally well at it though.

## Why This Blog

There are managing blogs, books, and all kind of tools to become a great manager. All of them assume a certain environment, which is different to all of us.

This blog is my personal story of becoming an engineering manager. This is my journal of a lot of firsts, a lot of questions I ask myself, a lot of struggle I will experience. Writing my thoughts down at least once a week should help me reflecting on what is happening, while provide an inside view to readers who may experience similar situations as well.

All opinions here are my own. If you disagree with them, that's fine and I'm happy to know your point of view. If you like them, make sure to share them.
